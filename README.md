## Translator guide
If you want to use Laima in a language that is not yet supported, you can provide it! Simply clone the project, create a folder with the [two-letter abbrevation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) of your language and a subfolder LC_MESSAGES under laima/i18n. Copy the laima.po in it, and translate it (see example of existing languages). You can use [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) to help you in the task. Finally, do a push request, your help will be very appreciated!
